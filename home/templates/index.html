                <p>Well, I hope it's the former! But seriously my work thrives from the feedback you can give. So once you have your project delivered, I would really like it if you could give me a review and say how much you liked the service(fingers crossed!). Lastly but not least, I would love it if you would allow me to host your project on my online portfolio. Which will aid me in securing more fantastic clients like yourself.
